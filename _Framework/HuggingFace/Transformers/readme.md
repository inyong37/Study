State-of-the-art Machine Learning for PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX.

Transformers provides APIs and tools to easily download and train state-of-the-art pretrained models. Using pretrained models can reduce your compute costs, carbon footprint, and save you the time and resources required to train a model from scratch. These models support common tasks in different modalities, such as:

* Natural Language Processing: text classification, named entity recognition, question answering, language modeling, summarization, translation, multiple choice, and test generation.
* Computer Vision: image classification, object detection, and segmentation.
* Audio: automatic speech recognition and audio classification.
* Multimodal: table question answering, optical character recognition, information extraction from scanned documents, video classification, and visual question answering.

Transformers support framework interoperability between PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX. This proivdes the flexibility to use a different framework at each stage of a model's life; train a model in three lines of code in one framework, and load it for inference in another. Models can also be exported to a format like ONNX and TorchScript for deployment in production environments.
