# [PyTorch Image Models (timm)](https://huggingface.co/timm) | [GitHub](https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-image-models)

PyTorch Image Models (timm) is a collection of image layers, utilities, optimizers, schedulers, data-loaders / augmentations, and reference training / validation scripts that aim to pull together a wide variety of SOTA models with ability to reproduce ImageNet training results.

It comes packaged with >700 pretrained models, and is designed to be flexible and easy to use.

Installation:
```Bash
pip3 install timm
```

Verification:
```Bash
python -c "from timm import list_models; print(list_models(pretrained=True)[:5])"
```
