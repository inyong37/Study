# [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/): Machine Learning in Python | [GitHub](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn)

- Simple and efficient tools for perdictive data analysis
- Accessible to everybody, and reusable in various contexts
- Built on NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib
- Open source, commercially usable - BSD license

scikit-learn is a Python module for machine learning built on top of SciPy and is distributed under the 3-Clause BSD license. The project was started in 2007 by David Cournapeau as a Google Summer of Code project, and since then many volunteers have contributed. It is currently maintained by a team of volunteers.

## [Classification](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html#supervised-learning)

Identifying which category an object belongs to.

Applications: Spam detections, image recognition.

Algorithms: [SVM](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html), [Nearest Neighbors](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neighbors.html), [Random Forest](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html#forests-of-randomized-trees).

## [Regression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html#supervised-learning)

Prediciton a continuous-valued atttribute assicated with an object.

Applications: Drug response, Stock prices.

Algorithms: SVR, [Nearest Neighbors](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neighbors.html), [Random Forest](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html#forests-of-randomized-trees). 

## [Clustering](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html#clustering)

Automatic grouping of similar objects into sets.

Applications: Customer segmentation, Grouping experiment outcomes.

Algorithms: k-Means, spectral clustering, mean-shift.

## [Dimensionality reduction](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/decomposition.html)

Reducing the number of random variables to consider.

Applications: Visualization, Increased efficiency.
