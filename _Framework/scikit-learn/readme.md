## *[Classification](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html#supervised-learning)*

Identifying which category an object belongs to.

Applications: Spam detections, image recognition.

Algorithms: [SVM](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html), [Nearest Neighbors](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neighbors.html), [Random Forest](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html#forests-of-randomized-trees).

## _[Regression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html#supervised-learning)_

Prediciton a continuous-valued atttribute assicated with an object.

Applications: Drug response, Stock prices.

Algorithms: SVR, [Nearest Neighbors](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neighbors.html), [Random Forest](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/ensemble.html#forests-of-randomized-trees). 

## _[Clustering](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html#clustering)_

Automatic grouping of similar objects into sets.

Applications: Customer segmentation, Grouping experiment outcomes.

Algorithms: k-Means, spectral clustering, mean-shift.
