# [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/): Machine Learning in Python | [GitHub](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn)

- Simple and efficient tools for perdictive data analysis
- Accessible to everybody, and reusable in various contexts
- Built on NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib
- Open source, commercially usable - BSD license

scikit-learn is a Python module for machine learning built on top of SciPy and is distributed under the 3-Clause BSD license. The project was started in 2007 by David Cournapeau as a Google Summer of Code project, and since then many volunteers have contributed. It is currently maintained by a team of volunteers.
