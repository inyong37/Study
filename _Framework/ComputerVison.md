## :hammer_and_wrench: Detectron | [GitHub](https://github.com/facebookresearch/Detectron)

Detectron is Facebook AI Research's software system that implements state-of-the-art object detection algorithms, including Mask R-CNN. It is written in Python and powered by the Caffe2 deep learning framework.

Detectron is deprecated. Please see detectron2, a ground-up rewrite of Detectron in PyTorch.

## :hammer_and_wrench: Detectron2 | [GitHub](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2)

Detectron2 is Facebook AI Research's next generation library that provides state-of-the-art detection and segmentation algorithms. It is the successor of Detectron and maskrcnn-benchmark. It supports a number of computer vision research projects and production applications in Facebook.

## :hammer_and_wrench: [OpenMMLab](https://openmmlab.com/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/open-mmlab)

OpenMMLab builds the most influential open-source computer vision algorithm system in the deep learning era. It aims to

* provide high-quality libraries to reduce the difficulties in algorithm reimplementation
* create efficient deployment toolchains targeting a variety of backends and devices
* build a solid foundation for computer vision research and development
* bridge the gap between academic research and industrial applications with full-stack toolchains

Based on PyTorch, OpenMMLab develops MMEngine to provide universal training and evaluation egine, and MMCV to profice neural network operators and data transforms, which serves as a foundation of the whole project. Since the initial release in October 2018, OpenMMLab has release 30+ vision libraries, has implemented 300+ algorithms, and contains 2000+ pre-trained models.

### :books: MMDetection | [GitHub](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection)

MMDetection is an open source object detection toolbox based on PyTorch. It is a part of the OpenMMLab project.

## :hammer_and_wrench: [PaddlePaddle](https://www.paddlepaddle.org/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/paddlepaddle/paddle)

PaddlePaddle, as the first independent R&D deep learning platform in China, has been officially open-sourced to professional communities since 2016. It is an industrial platform with advanced technologies and rich features that cover core deep learning frameworks, basic model libraries, end-to-end development kits, tools & components as well as service platforms. PaddlePaddle is originated from industrial practices with dedication and commitments to industrialization. It has been widely adopted by a wide range of sectors including manufacturing, agriculture, enterprise service, and so on while serving more than 10.7 million developers, 235,000 companies and generating 860,000 models. With such advantages, PaddlePaddle has helped an increasing number of partners commercialize AI.
