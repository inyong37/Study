Gymnasium is an open source Python library for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms by providing a standard API to communicate between learning algorithms and environments, as well as a standard set of environments compliant with that API. This is a fork of OpenAI's Gym library by its maintainers (OpenAI handed over maintenance a few years ago to an outside team), and is where future maintenance will occur going forward.
