MATLAB makes DL easy for engineers, scientists, and domain experts. With tools and functions for managing and labeling large data sets, MATLAB also offers specialized toolboxes for working with machine learning, neural networks, computer vision, and automated driving. With just a few lines of code, MATLAB allows you to create and visualize models, and deploy models to servers and embedded devices without being an expert. MATLAB also enables users to automatically generate high performance CUDA code for DL and vision applications from MATLAB code.
