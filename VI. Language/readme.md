# Langauge: Programming Language

----------

## Low-level Programming Language | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-level_programming_language)
A low-level programming language is a programming language that provides little or no abstraction from a computer's instruction set architecture-commands or functions in the language map that are structurally similar to processor's instructions. Generally, this refers to either machine code or assembly language. Because of the low (hence the word) abstarction between the language and machine language, low-level languages are sometimes described as being "close to the hardware". Programs written in low-level languages tend to be relatively non-portable, due to being optimized for a certain type of system architecture.

## Machine Code | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code)
In computer programming, machine code, consisting of machine language instructions, is a low-level programming language used to directly control a computer's central processing unit (CPU). Each instruction causes the CPU to perform a very specific task, such as a load, a store, a jump, or an arithmetic logic unit (ALU) operation on one or more units of data in the CPU's registers or memory.

## Assembly Language | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language)
In computer programming, assembly language (or assembler language), often abbreviated asm, is any low-level programming language in which there is a very strong correspondence between the instructions in the language and the architecture's machine code instructions. Because assembly depends on the machine code instructions, every assembly language is designed for exactly one specific computer architecture. Assembly language may also be called symbolic machine code.

## High-level Programming Language | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language)
In computer science, a high-level programming language is a programming language with string abstraction from the details of the computer. In constrast to low-level programming language, it may use natural language elements, be easier to use, or may automate (or even hide entirely) significant areas of computer systems (e.g memory management), making the process of developing a program simpler and more understandable than when using a low-level language. The amount of abstraction provided defines how "high-level" a programming language is.

## C | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language))
C is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, while a static type system prevents unintended operations. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions and has found lasting use in applications previously coded in assembly language. Such applications include operating systems and various application software for computers, from supercomputers to embedded systems. C was originally developed at Bell Labs by Dennis Ritchie between 1972 and 1973 to make utilities running on Unix. Later, it was applied to re-implementing the kernel of the Unix operating system. During the 1980s, C gradually gained popularity. It has become one of the most widely used programming languages, with C compilers from various vendors available for the majority of existing computer architectures and operating systems. C has been standardized by the ANSI since 1989 (see ANSI C) and by the International Organization for Standardization. C is an imperative procedural language. It was designed to be compiled using a relatively straightforward compiler to provide low-level access to memory and language constructs that map efficiently to machine instructions, all with minimal runtime support. Despite its low-level capabilities, the language was designed to encourage cross-platform programming. A standards-compliant C program written with portability in mind can be compiled for a wide variety of computer platforms and operating systems with few changes to its source code. The language is available on various platforms, from embedded microcontrollers to supercomputers.[13]

## JAVA | [Homepage](https://www.java.com/en/) | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language))
The Javaâ„¢ Programming Language is a general-purpose, concurrent, strongly typed, class-based object-oriented language. It is normally compiled to the bytecode instruction set and binary format defined in the Java Virtual Machine Specification.[10] Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based, object-oriented, and designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub, particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.[9]

## C++ | [cpp reference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/) | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B)
C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes". The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and IBM, so it is available on many platforms.

C++ was designed with an orientation toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights. C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications, including desktop applications, video games, servers (e.g. e-commerce, web search, or databases), and performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes).

C++ is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), with the latest standard version ratified and published by ISO in December 2020 as ISO/IEC 14882:2020 (informally known as C++20). The C++ programming language was initially standardized in 1998 as ISO/IEC 14882:1998, which was then amended by the C++03, C++11, C++14, and C++17 standards. The current C++20 standard supersedes these with new features and an enlarged standard library. Before the initial standardization in 1998, C++ was developed by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs since 1979 as an extension of the C language; he wanted an effiecient and flexible language similar to C that also provided high-level features for program organization. Since 2012, C++ is on a three-year release schedule, with C++23 the next planned standard.

## HTML: HyperText Markup Language | [Homepage](https://whatwg.org/) | [Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) | [Tutorial (KR)](https://opentutorials.org/course/3084)
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.[8]

HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages. HTML describes the structure of a Web page. HTML consists of a series of elements. HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content. HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.

## CSS: Cascading Style Sheets | [Homepage](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/) | [Tutorail (KR)](https://opentutorials.org/course/3086)
CSS is a simple mechanism for adding style to web documents.[1]

## XML: eXtensible Markup Language | [Homepage](https://www.w3.org/XML/)
Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a simple. very flexible text format derived from SGML (ISO 8879). Originally designed to meet the challenges of large-scale electronic publishing.[5]

## JSON: JavaScript Object Notation | [Homepage](https://www.json.org/json-en.html)
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999. JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others. These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange language.[11]

## C# | [Homepage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/)
C# (pronounced see sharp, like the musical note Câ™¯, but written with the number sign) is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language encompassing strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines. It was developed around 2000 by Microsoft as part of its .NET initiative, and later approved as an international standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) and ISO (ISO/IEC 23270:2018). Mono is the name of the free and open-source project to develop a compiler and runtime for the language. C# is one of the programming languages designed for the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI). C# was designed by Anders Hejlsberg, and its development team is currently led by Mads Torgersen. The most recent version is 8.0, which was released in 2019 alongside Visual Studio 2019 version 16.3.[12]

## Objective-C | [Homepage](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/ProgrammingWithObjectiveC/Introduction/Introduction.html)
Objective-C is the primary programming language when writing software for OS X and iOS. It's a superset of the C programming language and provides object-oriented capabilities and a dynamic runtime. Objective-C inherits the syntax, primitive types, and flow control statements of C and adds syntax for defining classes and methodes. It also adds language-level support for object graph management and object literals while providing dynamic typing and binding, deferring many responsibilities until runtime.

### Ahead Of Time (AOT) Compilation | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahead-of-time_compilation)
In computer science, Ahead-Of-Time (AOT) compilation is the act of compilting an (often) higher-level programming language into an (often) lower-level language before execution of a program, usually at build-time, to reduce the amount of work needed to be performed at run time.

Most often, It is associated with the act of compiling a high-level programming language such as C or C++, or an intermediate representation such as Java bytecode or .NET Framework Common Intermediate Language (CIL) code, into a native (system-dependent) machine code so that the resulting binary file can execute natively, just like a standard native compiler. When being used in this specific context, it's often seen as an opposite of just-in-time (JIT) compiling.

Speaking more generally, the taregt language of an AOT compilation are not necessarily specific to native machine code but are defined rather arbitarily. Some academic papers use this word to mean the act or compiling the Java bytecode to C or the timing when optimization pipeline are performed. An academin project uses this word to mean the act of pre-compiling JavaScript to a machine-dependent optimized IR for V8 (JavaScript engine) and to a machine independent bytecode for JavaScriptCore. Some industrial language implementations (e.g. Closure and Hermes JavaScript engine) use this work to mean the act of pre-compiling the source language to VM specific bytecode. Angular (web framework) uses this word to mean converting its HTML template and TypeScript to JavaScript.

In fact, since all static compilation are technically performed ahead of time, this particular wording are often used to emphaszie some kind of performance advantages from the act of such pre-compiling. The act of compiling Java to Java bytecode is hence rarely referred to as AOT since it's usually a requirment, not an optimization.

### Just In Time (JIT) Compilation | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation)
In computing, Just In Time (JIT) compilation (also dynamic translation or run-time compilations) is a way of executing computing code that involves compilation during execution of a program - at run time - rather than before execution. Most often, this consists of source code or more commoly bytecode translation to machine code, which is then executed directly. A system implementing a JIT compiler typically continuously analyses the code being executed and identifies parts of the code where the speedup gained from compilation or recompilation would outweigh the overhead of compiling that code.

JIT compilation is a combination of the two tranditional approaches to translation to machine code - ahead-fo-time compilation (AOT), and interpretation - and combines some advantages and drawbacks of both. Roughly, JIT compilation combines the speed of compiled code with the flexibility of interpretation, with the overhead of an interpreter and the additional overhead of compiling and linking (not just interpreting). JIT compilation is a form of dynamic compilation, and allows adaptive optimizatoin such as dynamic recompilation and microarchitecture-specific speedups. Interpretation and JIT compilation are particulary suited for dynamic programming languages, as the runtime system can handle late-bound data types and enforce security guarantees.

### Interpreter | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing))
In computer science, an interpreter is a computer program that directly executes instructions written in a programming or scripting language, without requiring them previously to have been compiled into a machine language program. An interpreter generally uses one of the following strategies for program execution: 1. Parse the source code and perform its behavior directly; 2. Translate source code into some efficient intermediate representation and immediately execute this; 3. Explicitly execute stored precompiled code made by a compiler which is part of the interpreter system.

Early verisons of LISP programming language and minicomputer and microcomputer BASIC dialects would be examples of the first type. Perl, Python, MATLAB, and Ruby are examples of the second, while UCSD Pascal is an example of the third type. Source programs are compiled ahead of time and stored as machine independent code, which is then linked at run-time and executed by an interpreter and/or compiler (for JIT systems). Some systems, such as Smalltalk and contemporary versions of BASIC and Java may also combine two and three. Interpreters of various types have also been constructed for many languages tranditionally associated with compilation, such as Algol, Fortran, Cobol, C and C++.

While interpretation and compilation are the two main means by which programming languages are implemented, they are not mutually exclusive, as most interpreting systems also perform some translation work, just like compilers. The terms "interpreted language" or "compiled language" signify that the canonical implementation of that language is an interpreter or a compiler, respectively. A high-level language is ideally an abstraction independent of particular implementations.
