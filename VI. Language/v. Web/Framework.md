## Front End
### React | [Homepage](https://reactjs.org/) | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React_(JavaScript_library))
A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is an open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components. Is is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and compaines. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. However, React is only concerned with state management and rendering that state to the DOM, so creating React applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for routing, as well as certain client-side functionality.

### Spring | [Homepage](https://spring.io/) | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_Framework)
The Spring Framework is an application framework and inversion of control container for the Java platform. The framework's core features can be used by any Java application, but there are extensions for building web applications on top of the Java EE (Enterprices Edition) platform. Although the framework does not impose any specific programming model, it has become popluar in the Java community as an addition to the Enterprice JavaBeans (EJB) model. The Spring Framework is open source.

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting-running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent the the user's web browswer. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm, unifying web-application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server-side and client-side scripts.

Though .js is the standard filename extension for JavaScript code, the name "Node.js" doesn't refer to a particular file in this context and is merely the name of the product. Node.js has an event-driven architecture capable of asynchronous I/O. These design choices aim to optimize throughput and scalability in web applications with many input/output operations, as well as for real-time Web applications (e.g., real-time communication programs and browser games).

The Node.js distributed development project was previously governed by the Node.js Foundation, and has now merged with the JS Foundation to form the OpenJS Foundation, which is facilitated by the Linux Foundation's Collaborative Projects program.

Corporate users of Node.js software include GoDaddy, Groupon, IBM, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Netflix, PayPal, Rakuten, SAP, Voxer, Walmark, Yahoo!, and Amazon Web Services.

### Electron | [Homepage](https://www.electronjs.org/) | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_(software_framework))
Electron (formerly known as Atom Shell) is an open-source software framework developed and maintained by GitHub. It allows for the development of desktop GUI applications using web technologies: it combines the Chromium rendering engine and the Node.js runtime. Electron is the main GUI framework behind several open-source projects including Atom, GitHub Desktop, Light Table, Visual Studio Code, Evernote, and WordPress Desktop.

## Back End
### Node.js | [Homepage](https://nodejs.org/en/) | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js)
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

### Deno | [Homepage](https://deno.land/) | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deno_(software))
Deno is a runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript that based on the V8 JavaScript engine and the Rust programming language. It was created by Ryan Dahl, original creator of Node.js, and is focuesd on productivity. It was announced by Dahl in 2018 during his talk "10 Things I Regret About Node.js". Deno explicitly takes on the role of both runtime and package manager within a single executable, rather than requiring a separate package-management program.
