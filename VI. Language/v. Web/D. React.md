If you havenâ€™t worked with JavaScript in the last few years, these three points should give you enough knowledge to feel comfortable reading the React documentation:

* We define variables with [`let`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let) and [`const`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const) statements. For the purposes of the React documentation, you can consider them equivalent to [`var`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var).
* We use the `class` keyword to define [JavaScript classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes). There are two things worth remembering about them. Firstly, unlike with objects, you *don't* need to put commas between class method definitions. Secondly, unlike many other languages with classes, in JavaScript the value of `this` in a method [depends on how it is called](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes#Boxing_with_prototype_and_static_methods).
* We sometimes use `=>` to define ["arrow functions"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions). They're like regular functions, but shorter. For example, `x => x * 2` is roughly equivalent to `function(x) { return x * 2; }`. Importantly, arrow functions [don't have their own `this` value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions#No_separate_this) so they're handy when you want to preserve the `this` value from an outer method definition.

**Don't worry if this is too much to take in at once. The [MDN JavaScript Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) is a stellar resource, and you can consult it whenever you get confused by something.**

Also, when you feel unsure about what some newer syntax means, you can use the [Babel REPL with the ES2015 preset](http://babeljs.io/repl/#?babili=false&browsers=&build=&builtIns=false&code_lz=MYewdgzgLgBAllApgWwjAvDA2gRgDQwBMBAzALoDcAUKJLACYgCuARgDaL0bxKoB0yAIYAHABQAPDAD4YkgFREAlBSA&debug=false&forceAllTransforms=false&shippedProposals=false&circleciRepo=&evaluate=false&fileSize=false&lineWrap=true&presets=es2015%2Creact%2Cstage-1%2Cstage-2%2Cstage-3&prettier=true&targets=Node-6.12&version=6.26.0&envVersion=) to check what equivalent older syntax it compiles to.
