### JDK (Java Development Kit) | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Development_Kit)
The Java Development Kit (JDK) is an implementation of either one of the Java Platform, Standard Edition, Java Platform, Enterprise Edition, or Java Platform, Micro Edition platforms released by Oracle Corporation in the form of a binary product aimed at Java developers on Solaris, Linux, macOS or Windows. The JDK includes a private JVM and a few other resources to finish the development of a Java application.[2] Since the introduction of the Java platform, it has been by far the most widely used Software Development Kit (SDK).

### OpenJDK | [Homepage](https://openjdk.java.net/) | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenJDK) | [OpenJDK 15 Download](https://jdk.java.net/15/)
The place to collaborate on an open-source implementation of the Java Platform, Standard Edition, and related projects.

OpenJDK (Open Java Development Kit) is a free and open-source implementation of the Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE). It is the result of an effort Sun Microsystems began in 2006. The implementation is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL) version 2 with a linking exception. Were it not for the GPL linking exception, components that linked to the Java class library would be subject to the terms of the GPL license. OpenJDK is the official reference implementation of Java SE since version 7.

### JRE (Java Runtime Environment) | [Wiki in JDK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Development_Kit)
The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) released by Oracle is a freely available software distribution containing a stand-alone JVM (HotSpot), the Java standard library (Java Class Library), a configuration tool, and—until its discontinuation in JDK 9—a browser plug-in. It is the most common Java environment installed on personal computers in the laptop and desktop form factor. Mobile phones including feature phones and early smartphones that ship with a JVM are most likely to include a JVM meant to run applications targeting Micro Edition of the Java platform. Meanwhile, most modern smartphones, tablet computers, and other handheld PCs that run Java apps are most likely to do so through support of the Android operating system, which includes an open source virtual machine incompatible with the JVM specification. (Instead, Google's Android development tools take Java programs as input and output Dalvik bytecode, which is the native input format for the virtual machine on Android devices.)

JDK 11 버전 이후로는 JRE가 포함되지 않는다.

### JVM (Java Virtual Machine) | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine)
A Java virtual machine (JVM) is a virtual machine that enables a computer to run Java programs as well as programs written in other languages that are also compiled to Java bytecode. The JVM is detailed by a specification that formally describes what is required in a JVM implementation. Having a specification ensures interoperability of Java programs across different implementations so that program authors using the Java Development Kit (JDK) need not worry about idiosyncrasies of the underlying hardware platform.

The JVM reference implementation is developed by the OpenJDK project as open source code and includes a JIT compiler called HotSpot. The commercially supported Java releases available from Oracle Corporation are based on the OpenJDK runtime. Eclipse OpenJ9 is another open source JVM for OpenJDK.

### Paid? Oracle JDK vs OpenJDK
Commercial version JDK is Oracle JDK and open source based JDK is OpenJDK. Oracle JDK has some pulgin used to pay, from Sun Microsystems
