## Mobile Application | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app)
A mobile application, also referred to as a mobile app or simply an app, is a computer program or software application designed to run on a mobile device such as a phone, tablet, or watch.

Mobile applications often stand in contrast to desktop applications which are designed to run on desktop compuiters, and web applications which run in mobile web browsers rather than directly on the mobile device.

### Native Application | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app#Native_app)
All apps targeted toward a particular mobile platform are known as native apps. Therefore, an app intended for Apple device does not run in Android. As a result, most businesses develop apps for multiple platforms.

### Web Application (Web-based Application) | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app#Web-based_app)
A web-based app is implemented with the standard web technologies of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Internet access is typically required for proper behavior or being able to use all features compared to offline usage. Most, if not all, user data is stored in the cloud.

The performance of these apps is similar to a web application running in a browser, which can be noticeably slower than the equivalent native app. It also may not have the same level of features as the native app.

### Hybrid Application | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_app#Hybrid_app)
The concept of the hybrid app is a mix of native and web-based apps. Apps developed using Apache Cordova, Xamarin, React Native, Sencha Touch, and other frameworks fall into this category.

These are made to support web and native technologies across multiple platforms. Moreover, these apps are easier and faster to develop. It involves ues of single codebase which works in multople mobile operating systems.

Despite such advantages, hybrid apps exhibit lower performance. Often, apps fail to bear the same look-and-feel in different mobile operating systems.
