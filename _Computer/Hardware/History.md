## IBM, Interantional Business Machines Corporation | [Homepage](https://www.ibm.com/us-en?lnk=fcc) | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM)
International Business Machine Corporation (IBM) is an American multipnational technology company headquartered in Armonk, New York, with oprations in over 170 countries. The company began in 1911, founded in Endicott, New York, as the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR) and was renamed International Business Machines in 1924. IBM is incorporated in New York.

IBM produces and sells computer hardware, middleware and software, and provides hosting and consulting services in areas ranging from mainframe computers to nanotechnology. IBM is also a major research organization, holding the record for most U.S. patents generated by a business (as of 2020) for 28 consecutive years. Inventions by IBM include the automated teller machine (ATM), the floppy disk, the hard disk drive, the magnetic stripe card, the relational database, the SQL programming language, the UPC barcode, and dynamic random-access memory (DRAM). The IBM mainframe, exemplified by the System/360, was the dominant computing platform during the 1960s and 1970s.

IBM has continually shifted business operations aimed at focusing on higher-value, more profitable markets. This includes spinning off printer manufacture Lexmark in 1991 and the sale of personal computer (ThinkPad/ThinkCentre) and x86-based server business to Lenovo (in 2005 and 2014, respectively), and acquiring companies such as PwC Consulting (2002), SPSS (2009), The Weather Company (2016), and Red Hat (2019). In 2015, IBM announced that it would go fabless, continuing to design semiconductors, but offloading manufacturing to GlobalFoundries, and in 2020, the company announced the spin off the Managed Infrastructure Services unit of its Golbal Technology Services division, with expected completion by the end of 2021.

Nicknamed Big Blue, IBM is one of 30 companies included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and on of the world's largest employers, with (as of 2018) over 350,000 employees, known as IBMers. At least 70% of IBMers are based outside the United States, and the country with the largest number of IMBers is India. IBM employees have been awarded five Nobel Prizes, six Turing Awards, ten National Medals of Technology (USA) and five National Medals of Science (USA).

### IBM Personal Computer | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer)
The IBM Personal Computer (model 5150. commoly known as the IBM PC) is the first computer released in the IBM PC model line and the basis for the IBM PC compatible de facto standard. Released on August 12, 1981, it was created by a team of engineers and designers directed by Don Estridge in Boca Raton, Florida.

The Machine was based on open architecture and a substantial market of third-party peripherals, expansion cards and software grew up rapidly to support it.

The PC had a substantial influence on the personal computer market. The specifications of the IBM PC became one of the most popular computer design standards in the world, and the only significant competition it faced from a non-compatible platform throughtout the 1980s was from the Apple Macintosh product line. The majority of modern personal computers are distant descendants of the IBM PC.

### IBM PC Compatible | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PC_compatible)
IBM PC compatible computers are similar to the original IBM PC, XT and AT that are able to use the same software and expansion cards. Such computers were referred to as PC clones, or IBM clones. The term IBM PC compatible is now a historical description only, since IBM no longer sells personal computers. The industry jargon PC sometimes doesn't mean personal computer generally, but rather an x86 computer capable of running Microsoft's Windows operating system, IBM's OS/2, or Linux, in contrast to Apple's macOS, which usually gives the computer the designation of Mac.

These clones duplicate almost exactly all the significant features of the IBM PC architecture. This was facilitated by IBM's choice of commodity hardware components and by various manufacturers' ability to reverse engineer the BIOS firmware using a clean room design technique. Columbia Data Products built the first clone of the IBM personal computer by a clean room implementation of its BIOS.

Early IBM PC compatibles used the same computer bus as the original PC and AT models. The IBM At compatible bus was later named the Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) bus by manufacturers of compatible computers.

Descendants of the IBM PC compatibles comprise the majority of desktop computers on the market presently, with the dominant operating system being Microsoft Windows, although interoperability with the bus structure and peripherals of the original PC architecture may be limited or non-existent. Some of these computers ran MS-DOS but had enough hardware differences that IBM compatible software could not be used; examples include slight differences in the memory map, serial ports or hardware.

Only the Machintosh kept significant market share without having compatibility with the IBM PC.

### Mainframe | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainframe_computer)
A mainframe computer, informally called a mainframe or big iron, is a computer used primarily by large organizations for critical applications, bulk data processing (such as the census and industry and consumer statics, enterprise resource planning, and large-scale transaction processing). A mainframe computer is larger and has more processing power than some other classes of computers, such as minicomputers, servers, workstations, and personal computers. Most large-scale computer-system architectures were established in the 1960s but they continue to evolve. Mainframe computers are often used as servers.

The term mainframe derived from the large cabinet, called a main frame, that houses the central processing unit and main memory of early computers. Later, the term mainframe was used to distinguish high-end commercial computers from less powerful machines.

### IBM System/360 | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_System/360)
The IBM System/360 (S/360) is a family of mainframe computer systems that was announced by IBM on April 7, 1964, and delivered between 1965 and 1978. It was the first family of computers designed to cover the complete range of applications, from small to large, both commercial and scientific. The design made a clear distinction between architecture and implementation, allowing IBM to release a suite of compatible designs at different prices. All but the only partially compatible Model 44 and the most expensive systems use microcode to implement the instruction set, which features 8-bit byte addressing and binary decimal and hexadecimal floating-point calculations.

### ThickPad | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThinkPad)
ThinkPad is a line of business-oriented laptop computers and tablets designed, developed and marketed by Lenovo. It was initially sold by IBM until 2005. ThinkPads have a distinct black, boxy design language, inspired by a japanese bento lunchbox, which originated in 1990 and is still used in some models.

The ThinkPad line was first developed at the IBM Yamato Facility in Japan, and the first ThinkPads were released in October 1992.

ThinkPads have seen significant success in the business market. ThinkPad laptops have been used in outer space and for many yesars were the only laptops certified for use on the international Space Station.
