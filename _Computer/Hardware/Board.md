# Motherboard | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motherboard)
A motherboard (also called mainboard, main circuit board, system board, baseboard, planar bload, logic board, or mobo) is the main printed circuit board in general purpose computers and other expandable systems. It holds and allows communication between many of the crucial electronic components of a system, and provides connectors for other peripherals. Unlike a backplane, a motherboard usually contains significant sub-systems, such as the central processor, the chipset's input/output and memory controllers, interface connectors, and other components integrated for general use.

# Backplane | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backplane)
A backplane (or backplane system) is a group of electrical connectors in parallel with each other, so that each pin of each connector is linked to the same relative pin of all the other connectors, forming a computer bus. It is used as a backbone to connect several printed circuit boards together to make up a complete computer system. Backpanes commonly use a printed circuit board, but wire-wrapped backplanes have also been used in minicomputerse and high-reliability applications.

### Motherboard vs. Backplane
A backplane is generally differentiated from a motherboard by the lack of on-board processing and storage elements. A backplane uses plug-in cards for storage and processing.
