# Sensor | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor)

A sensor is a device, module, machine, or subsystem whose purpose is to detect events or changes in its environment and send the information to other electronics. A sensor is always used with other electronics.

## Image Sensor | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_sensor)

An image sensor or imager is a sensor that detects and conveys information used to make an image. It does so by converting the variable attenuation of light waves (as they pass through or reflect off objects) into signals, small bursts of current that convey the information. The waves can be light or other electromagnetic radiation. Image sensors are used in electronic imaging devices of both analog and digital types, which include digital cameras, camera modules, camera phones, optical mouse devices, medical imaging equipment, night vision equipment such as thermal imaging devices, radar, sonar, and others. As technology changes, electronic and digital imaging tend to replace chmical and analog imaging.

### Charge-Coupled Device (CCD) | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge-coupled_device) -> Integrated Circuit

CCD based on MOS capacitors.

### Active-Pixel Sensor (APS) | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active-pixel_sensor)

CMOS based on MOSFET (MOS field-effect transistor) amplifiers.

An active-pixel sensor (APS) is an image sensor where each pixel sensor unit cell has a photodetector (typically a pinned photodiode) and one or more active transistors. In a metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) active-pixel sensor, MOS field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) are used as amplifiers. There are different types of APS, including the early NMOS APS and the much more common complementary MOS (CMOS) APS, also known as the CMOS sensor, which is widely used in digital camera technologies such as cell phone cameras, web cameras, most modern digital pocket cameras, most digital single-lens reflex cameras (DSLRs), and mirrorless interchangeable-lens cameras (MILCs). CMOS sensors emerged as an alternative to charge-coupled device (CCD) image sensors and eventually outsold them by the mid-2000s.

## Gyroscope | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyroscope)

A gyroscope is a device used for measuring or maintaining orientation and angular velocity. It is a spinning wheel or disc in which the axis of rotation (spin axis) is free to assume any orientation by itself. When rotating, the orientation of this axis is unaffected by tiliting or rotation of the mounting, according to the conservation of angular momentum.

Gyroscopes based on other operating principles also exist, such as the microchip-packaged MEMS gyroscopes found in electronic devices (sometimes called gyrometers), solid-state ring lasers, fibre optic gyroscopes, and the extremely sensitive quantum gyroscope.

### Vibrating Structure Gyroscope | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibrating_structure_gyroscope)

A vibrating structure gyroscope, defined by the IEEE as a Coriolis Vibratory Gyroscope (CVG), is a gyroscope that uses a vibrating structure to determine the rate of rotation. A vibrating structure gyroscope functions much like the halteres of files (insects in the order Diptera).

## Accelerometer | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerometer)

An accelerometer is a tool that measures proper acceleration. Proper acceleration is the acceleration (the rate of change of velocity) of a body in its own instantaneous rest frame; this is different from coordinate acceleration, which is acceleration in a fixed coordinate system.

## Ultrasonic Sensor | [TI](https://www.ti.com/sensors/specialty-sensors/ultrasonic/overview.html)

Ultrasonic sound waves are vibrations at a frequency above the range of human hearing (>20kHz) that can travel throught a variety of mediums (air or fluid). Techniques like time of flight or Doppler are used to measure flow, detect objects, perform concentration analysis and measure distances - without making physical contact. Ultrasonic sensors can be used to detect a wide variety of materials regardless of shape, transparency or color.

### [IR sensor vs. Ultrasonic sensor](https://m.blog.naver.com/fiberk2/220810561244)

Commons:
- Measuring distance

Difference:
- IR: Calculated in triangular geometry by measuring the angle with the focal point
  - Sensitive to color (black absorbs, and white reflects)
- Ultrasonic: Calculate the time until reflection
  - Sensitive to dust and water
  - Sensitive to temperature (calcuating distance depends on temperature)
  - Difficult to detect the object, since materials such as cloth and cotton absorb ultrasonic waves
