## :package: Direct Attached Storage (DAS) | [WiKi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct-attached_storage)

Direct-attached storage (DAS) is digital storage directly attached to the computer accessing it, as opposed to storage accessed over a computer network (i.e. network-attached storage). Examples of DAS include hard drives, solid-state drives, optical disc drives, and storage on external drives. The name "DAS" is a retronym to contrast with storage area network (SAN) and network-attached storage (NAS).
