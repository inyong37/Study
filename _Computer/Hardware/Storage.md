Direct-attached storage (DAS) is digital storage directly attached to the computer accessing it, as opposed to storage accessed over a computer network (i.e. network-attached storage). Examples of DAS include hard drives, solid-state drives, optical disc drives, and storage on external drives. The name "DAS" is a retronym to contrast with storage area network (SAN) and network-attached storage (NAS).
