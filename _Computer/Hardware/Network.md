# Network | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network)
A computer network is a group of computers that use a set of common communication protocols over digital interconnections for the purpose of sharing resources located on or provided by the network nodes. THe interconnections between nodes are formed from a broad spectrum of telecommunication network technologies, based on physically wired, optical, and wireless radio-frequency methods that may be arranged in a variety of network topologies.

# Telecommunications Network | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_network)
A telecommunications network is a group of nodes interconnected by links that are used to exchange messages between the nodes. The links my use a variety of technologies based on the methodologies of circuit switching, message switching, or packet switching, to pass messages and signals.

## Data Networks
Data networks are used extensively throughout the world for communication between individuals and organizations. Data networks can be connected to allow users seamless access to resources that are hosted outside of the particular provider they are connected to. The Internet is the best example of many data networks from different organizations all operating under a single address space.

## Node | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node_(networking))
In telecommunications networks, a node is either a redistribution point or a communication endpoint. The definition of a node depends on the network and protocol layer referred to. A physical network node is an electronic device that is attached to a network, and is capable of creating, receiving, or transmitting information over a communication channel. A passive distribution point such as a distribution frame or patch panel is consequently not a node.

# Networking Hardware | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Networking_hardware)
Networking hardware, also known as network equipment or computer networking devices, are electronic devices which are required for communication and interaction between devices on a computer network. Specially, they mediate data transmission in a computer network. Units which are the last receiver or generate data are called hosts, end systems or data termianl equipment.

## Core
Core network components interconnect other network components.

### Gateway | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway_(telecommunications))

A networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks. Routers perform the "traffic directing" functions on the Internet. A data packet is typically forwarded from one router to another through the networks that constitute the internetwork until it reaches its destination node. It works on OSI layer 3.

### Switch | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_switch)
A device that connects devices together on a computer network, by using packet switching to receive, process and forward data to the destination device. Unlike less advanced network hubs, a network switch forwards data only to one or multiple devices that need to receive it, rather than broadcasting the same data out of each of its ports. It works on OSI layer 2.

### Bridge | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridging_(networking))
A device that connects multiple network segments. It works on OSI layers 1 and 2.

An electronic device that receives a signal and retransmits it at a higher level or higher power, or onto the other side of an obstruction, so that the signal can cover longer distances.

### Repeater Hub | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_hub)
For connecting multiple Ethernet devices together and making them act as a single network segment. It has multiple input/output (I/O) ports, in which a signal introduced at the input of any port appears at the output of every port except the original incoming. A hub works at the physical layer (layer 1) of the OSI model. Repeater hubs also participate in collision detection, forwarding a jam signal to all ports if it detects a collision. Hubs are now largely obsolete, having been replaced by network switches except in very old installations or specialized applications.

### Gateway | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway_(telecommunications))
A gateway is a piece of networking hardware or software used in telecommunications networks that allows data to flow from one discrete network to another. Gateways are distinct from routers or switches in that they communicate using more than one protocol to connect multiple networks and can operate at any of the seven layers of the open systems interconnection model (OSI).

The term gateway can also loosely refer to a computer or computer program configured to perform the tasks of a gateway, such as a default gateway or router, and in the case of HTTP, gateway is also often used as a synonym for reverse proxy.

#### IoT gateway
An Internet of things (IoT) gateway provides the bridge (protocol converter) between IoT devices in the field, the cloud, and user equipment such as smartphones. The IoT gateway provides a communication link between the field and the cloud, and may provide offline services and real-time control of devices in the field.

To achieve sustainable interoperability in the Internet of things ecosystem, two dominant architectures for data exchange protocols are used: bus-based (DDS, REST, XMPP) and broker-based (AMQP, CoAP, MQTT, JMI). Protocols that support information exchange between interoperable domains are classified as message centric (AMQP, MQTT, JMS, REST) or data-centric (DDS, CoAP, XMPP). Interconnected devices communicate using lightweight protocols that don't require extensive CPU resources. C, Java, Python and some scripting languages are the preferred choices of IoT application developers. IoT nodes use separate IoT gateways to handle protocol conversion, database storage or decision making (e.g. collision handling), in order to supplement the low intelligence of devices.

### Mesh Networking | [WiKi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesh_networking)
A mesh networking (or simply meshnet) is a local area network topology in which the infrastructure nodes (i.e. bridges, swithces, and other infrastructure devices) connect directly, dynamically and non-hierarchially to as many other nodes as possible and cooperate with one another to efficiently route data to and from clients.

This lack of dependency on one node allows for every node to participate in the relay of information. Mesh networks dynamically self-organize and self-configure, which can reduce installation overhead. The ability to self-configure enables dynamic distribution of workloads, particularly in the event a few nodes should fail. This in turn contributes to fault-tolerance and reduced maintenance costs.

Mesh topology may be contrasted with conventional star/tree local network topologies in which the bridges/switches are directly linked to only a small subset of other bridges/switches, and the links between these infrastructure neighbours are hierarchical. While star-and-tree topologies are very well established, highly standardized and vendor-neutral, vendors of mesh network devices have not yet all agreed on common standards, and interoperability between devices from different vendors is not yet assured.

### Mesh Wi-Fi | [TP-Link](https://www.tp-link.com/kr/mesh-wifi/)
안정적인 네트워크가 중요한 비즈니스 상황에서만 사용되었다. 최근 소비자 시장에도 진출해 빠른 속도와 넓은 범위의 Wi-Fi 네트워크를 제공한다.

Mesh Wi-Fi는 사각지대를 제거하고 가정 전체에서 중단없는 WiFi를 제공하기 위해 설계된 가정용 WiFi시스템이다. Mesh 시스템은 네트워크에 연결된 디바이스가 더 빠른 속도, 더 넓은 커버리즈 그리고 신뢰할 수 있는 연결성을 갖도록 도와줍니다. 기존의 공유기가 단일 포인트 지점에서 WiFi를 전송했다면 Mesh WiFi 시스템은 여러 개의 액세스 포인트에 신호를 전달합니다. 하나의 디바이스가 모뎀에 연결되면 해당 디바이스는 메인 허브가 됩니다. 다른 디바이스(노드)는 공유기의 신호를 잡고 다시 신호를 보냅니다. 그 결과 사용자가 어디에 있든 강한 신호의 무선 네트워크를 이용할 수 있습니다.

### [NFC](http://nearfieldcommunication.org/) | [NordVPN](https://nordvpn.com/ko/blog/nfc-ran/) | [Doorlock NEWS (KR)](https://www.mk.co.kr/news/it/view/2021/02/133597/) | [Mobile Blog (KR)](https://m.blog.naver.com/shin6752/222129724466)

Near field communication, abbreviated NFC, is a form of contactless communication between devices like smartphones or tablets. Contactless communication allows a user to wave the smartphone onver a NFC compatible device to send information without needing to touch the devices together or go throught multiple steps setting up a connection.

NFC는 Wi-Fi, 3G, LTE, 전원 또는 수동 페어링이 필요 없는 기술인 RFID에서 발전했습니다. NFC 칩은 보안 카드 또는 각종 결제 및 여행 카드에서 찾을 수 있습니다. 오늘날 대부분의 스마트폰에도 NFC가 있으며 주로 비접촉 모바일 결제에 사용됩니다.

- 카드 모드(Card Mode): NFC 단말이 스마트 카드처럼 동작합니다. 예를 들어, 안드로이드 폰을 교통 카드로 사용하는 경우입니다.
- 태그 읽기/쓰기(R/W Mode): NFC 단말이 NFC 태그로부터 데이터를 읽거나, NFC 태그에 데이터를 씁니다. 예를 들어 태그 읽어서 특정 웹 사이트로 연결하는 경우입니다.
- P2P 모드(P2P Mode): NFC 단말이 다른 NFC 단말로부터 데이터를 읽어옵니다. 예를 들어, NFC 단말 사이에 연락처를 전달하는 경우입니다.

주의할 점은 NFC를 활용한 도어록 해제방식은 피해야합니다. NFC의 경우, 한 개의 일련 번호를 대량으로 생산하기 때문에 내 휴대전화가 아닌 다른 사람의 휴대전화로도 열릴 수 있는 개연성이 충분합니다. 한국소비자원은 "교통카드, 신용카드, 휴대전화에 내장된 NFC 카드 등을 등록해 사용하지 말아햐 한다"고 강조했습니다.

#### NFC 태그란?

NFC 태그는 NFC 칩이라고 생각하면 쉽게 이해할 수 있습니다. NFC 태그는 전자 유도의 원리에 따라 작동하므로 충전을 할 필요는 없습니다. 칩 자체는 아주 작으므로 명함, 펜, 열쇠 고리, 손목 밴드 등 많은 곳에 쉽게 손쉽게 설치할 수 있습니다. 또한 마이크로 칩과 여러 겹의 구리선으로 연결되어 있으며 이를 통해 주파수를 발생합니다. 마이크로 칩은 NFC를 지원하는 장치에서 읽을 수 있는 정보를 포함합니다.

또한 NFC 태그에 접촉하면 휴대폰이 매너 모드로 전환하거나, Wi-Fi를 켜기, 혹은 취침 모드로 들어가는 등의 지정한 동작을 수행하도록 할 수도 있습니다.

태그의 복잡성은 다양할 수 있습니다. 단순한 태그는 읽기 및 쓰기 의미 체계만 제공하며 때로는 일회성 프로그래밍 가능한 영역을 사용하여 카드를 읽기 전용으로 설정합니다. 더 복잡한 태그는 수학 연산을 제공하며 섹터에 대한 접속을 인증하기 위해 암호화 하드웨어를 사용합니다. 가장 정교한 태그는 태그에서 실행되는 코드와 복잡한 상호작용이 가능하도록 하는 운영 환경을 포함합니다. 태그에 저장되는 데이터를 다양한 형식으로 작성할 수도 있지만, 다수의 안드로이드 프레임워크 API는 NDEF(NFC Data Exchange Format)라는 NFC Forum 표준을 기반으로 합니다.

#### NFC와 RFID의 차이점

- 수신 범위

NFC는 고작 10cm 정도인 것에 비해 일반적으로 RFID가 NFC보다 수신 범위가 긴데다 RFID는 단방향 통신이고, NFC는 양방향 통신입니다.

- 태그 및 리더 역할의 유동성

RFID는 태그와 리더 역할이 고정되어 있습니다. 예를 들어 결제를 하는 상황에서 RFID는 태그의 역할로서 정보를 내주는 역할만 수행하고 카드 리더기는 RFID에서 정보를 읽는 역할을 수행합니다. 반면 NFC는 상황에 따라 태그와 리더 역할을 유동적으로 변경할 수 있습니다.

#### NFC와 블루투스 차이점

NFC와 Bluetooth는 모두 휴대폰에서 사용할 수 있는 비교적 단거리 통신 기술입니다.

- NFC는 블루투스보다 느린 속도로 작동하고 범위가 훨씬 짧지만 전력을 훨씬 적게 소비하고 페어링이 필요하지 않는다. NFC는 일반적으로 블루투스보다 빠르게 설정되지만 블루투스의 저에너지보다 전송 속도가 낮습니다. 하지만 NFC를 사용하면 수동 구성을 수행하여 장치를 식별하는 대신 두 NFC 장치 간의 연결이 0.1초 이내에 자동으로 설정됩니다. NFC의 최대 데이터 전송 속도 또한 블루투스보다 느립니다.

- 위에 서술되어 있듯이, NFC의 최대 수신 거리가 짧으므로 수신 거리 미만이면 연결이 자동으로 끊기기 때문에, 원치 않는 끼어들기의 가능성이 줄어듭니다. 신호를 전송하는 물리적 장치와의 상관 관계를 복잡하게 만드는 사람이 많고 혼잡한 지역에 특히 적합합니다.

### [Bluetooth](https://www.bluetooth.com/) | [IEEE](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1368913)

Bluetooth is a standard for short range, low power, and low cost wireless communication that uses radio technology. Over 2100 compaines around the world already support Bluetooth technology. The wireless personal area network (WPAN) technology, based on the Bluetooth specification, is now an IEEE standard under the denomination of 802.15 WPANs. This work presents an overview about the Bluetooth communication. Bluetooth wireless technology encompasses several key points that facilitate its widespread adoption: 1) it is an open specification that is publicly available and royalty free; 2) its short-range wireless capability allows peripheral devices to communicate over a single air-interface, replacing the cables that use connectors with a multitude of shapes, sizes and numbers of pins; 3) Bluetooth supports both voice and data, making it an ideal technology to enable many types of devices to communicate; and 4) Bluetooth uses an unregulated frequency band available anywhere in the world.. To fully realize the Bluetooth vision, full networking of multiple Bluetooth devices is required. This leads to the investigation of Bluetooth scatternets, which must address ascatternet formation and reconfiguration, scheduling, and routing issues.

#### Bluetooth Classic

The Bluetooth Classic radio, also referred to as Bluetooth Basic Rate/Enhanced Data Rate (BR/EDR), is a low power radio that streams data over 79 channels in the 2.4GHz unlicensed industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) frequency band. Supporting point-to-point device communication, Bluetooth Classic is mainly used to enable wireless audio streaming and has become the standard radio protocol behind wireless speakers, headphones, and in-car entertainment systems. The Bluetooth Classic radio also enables data transfer applications, including mobile printing.

#### Bluetooth Low Energy (LE)

The Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) radio is designed for very low power operation. Transmitting data over 40 channels in the 2.4GHz unlicensed ISM frequency band, the Bluetooth LE radio provides developers a tremendous amount of flexibility to build products that meet the unique connectivity requirements of their market. Bluetooth LE supports multiple communication topologies, expanding from point-to-point to broadcast and, most recently, mesh, enabling Bluetooth technology to support the creation of reliable, large-scale device networks. While initially known for its device communications capabilities, Bluetooth LE is now also widely used as a device positioning technology to address the increasing demand for high accuracy indoor location services. Bluetooth LE now includes features that enable one device to determine the presence, distance, and direction of another device.
