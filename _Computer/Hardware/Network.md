# Network | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network)
A computer network is a group of computers that use a set of common communication protocols over digital interconnections for the purpose of sharing resources located on or provided by the network nodes. THe interconnections between nodes are formed from a broad spectrum of telecommunication network technologies, based on physically wired, optical, and wireless radio-frequency methods that may be arranged in a variety of network topologies.

# Telecommunications Network | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_network)
A telecommunications network is a group of nodes interconnected by links that are used to exchange messages between the nodes. The links my use a variety of technologies based on the methodologies of circuit switching, message switching, or packet switching, to pass messages and signals.

## Data Networks
Data networks are used extensively throughout the world for communication between individuals and organizations. Data networks can be connected to allow users seamless access to resources that are hosted outside of the particular provider they are connected to. The Internet is the best example of many data networks from different organizations all operating under a single address space.

## Node | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node_(networking))
In telecommunications networks, a node is either a redistribution point or a communication endpoint. The definition of a node depends on the network and protocol layer referred to. A physical network node is an electronic device that is attached to a network, and is capable of creating, receiving, or transmitting information over a communication channel. A passive distribution point such as a distribution frame or patch panel is consequently not a node.

# Networking Hardware | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Networking_hardware)
Networking hardware, also known as network equipment or computer networking devices, are electronic devices which are required for communication and interaction between devices on a computer network. Specially, they mediate data transmission in a computer network. Units which are the last receiver or generate data are called hosts, end systems or data termianl equipment.

## Core
Core network components interconnect other network components.

### Gateway | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway_(telecommunications))
An interface providing a compatibliliy between networks by converting transmission speeds, protocols, codes, or security measures.

### Router | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router_(computing)) | [Wiki (KR)](https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EB%9D%BC%EC%9A%B0%ED%84%B0)
A networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks. Routers perform the "traffic directing" functions on the Internet. A data packet is typically forwarded from one router to another through the networks that constitute the internetwork until it reaches its destination node. It works on OSI layer 3.

### Switch | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_switch)
A device that connects devices together on a computer network, by using packet switching to receive, process and forward data to the destination device. Unlike less advanced network hubs, a network switch forwards data only to one or multiple devices that need to receive it, rather than broadcasting the same data out of each of its ports. It works on OSI layer 2.

### Bridge | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridging_(networking))
A device that connects multiple network segments. It works on OSI layers 1 and 2.

### Repeater | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repeater)
An electronic device that receives a signal and retransmits it at a higher level or higher power, or onto the other side of an obstruction, so that the signal can cover longer distances.

### Repeater Hub | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_hub)
For connecting multiple Ethernet devices together and making them act as a single network segment. It has multiple input/output (I/O) ports, in which a signal introduced at the input of any port appears at the output of every port except the original incoming. A hub works at the physical layer (layer 1) of the OSI model. Repeater hubs also participate in collision detection, forwarding a jam signal to all ports if it detects a collision. Hubs are now largely obsolete, having been replaced by network switches except in very old installations or specialized applications.

WAP는 컴퓨터 네트워크에서 와이파이를 이용한 관련 표준을 이용하여 무선 장치들을 유선 장치에 연결할 수 있게 하는 장치이다. 

### :bulb: Setup ipTIME AP (ex. N104T)
1. enter `http://192.168.0.1/` with internet browser
2. click `무선마법사` setup
3. click `설정마법사` and then setup

### Structured Calbing | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_cabling)

## Hybrid
Hybrid components can be found in the core or border of a network.

### Multilayer Switch (MLS) | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_switch)
A switch that, in addition to switching on OSI layer 2, provides functionality at higher protocol layers.

### Protocol Converter | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_converter)
A hardware device that converts between two differenct types of transmission, for interoperation.

### Bridge Router (Brouter) | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_router)
A device that works as a bridge and as a router. The brouter routes packets for known protocols and simply forwards all other packets as a bridge would.

## Border
Hardware or software components which typically sit on the connection point of different networks (for example, between an internal network and en external network) include:

### Proxy Server | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server)
Computer network service which allows client to make indirect network connections to other network services.

### Firewall | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firewall_(computing))
A piece of hardware or software put on the network to prevent some communications forbidden by the network policy. A firewall typically establishes a barrier between a trusted, secure internal network and another outside network, such as the Internet, that is assumed to not be secure or trusted.

### Network Address Translater (NAT) | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation)
Network service (provided as hardware or as software) that converts internal to external network addresses and vice versa.

### Residential Gateway | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residential_gateway)
Interface between a WAN connection to an internet service provider and the home network.

## End Stations
Other hardware devices used for establishing networks or dial-up connections include:

### Network Interface Controller (NIC) | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_interface_controller)
A device connecting a computer to a wire-based computer network.

### Wireless Network Interface Controller | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_network_interface_controller)
A device connecting the attached computer to a radio-biased computer network.

### Modem | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modem)
Device that modulates an analog "carrier" signal (such as sound) to encode digital information, and that also demodulates such a carrier signal to decode the transmitted information. Used (for example) when a computer communicates with another computer over a telephone network.

### ISDN Terminal Adapter (TA) | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_adapter)
