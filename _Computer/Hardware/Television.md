# Television (TV) | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television)

Television is a telecommunication system for broadcasting and receiving moving pictures and sound over a distance. The term has come to refer to all the aspects of television from the television set to the programming and transmission. The word is derived from mixed Latin and Greek roots, meaning "far sight": Greek "tele", far, and Latin vision, sight (from video, vis- to see).

## Smart TV | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_TV)

A smart TV, also known as a connected TV (CTV), is a tranditional television set with integrated Internet and interactive Web 2.0 features, which allows users to stream music and videos, browse the internet, and view photos. Smart TVs are a technological convergence of computers, television, and digital media players. Besides the tranditional functions of television sets provided through tranditional broadcasting media, these devices can provide access to over-the-top media services such as streaming television and internet radio, along with home networking access.

## Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol_television)

Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) is the delivery of television content over Internet Protocol (IP) networks. This is in contrast to delivery through tranditional terrestrial, satellite, and cable television format. Unlike downloaded meida, IPTV offers the ability to stream the source media continuously. As a result, a client media player can being playing the content (such as a TV channel) almost immediately. This is known as streaming media.

Although IPTV uses the Internet protocol it is not limited to television streamed from the Internet (Internet television). IPTV is widely deployed in subscriber-based telecommunications networks with high-speed access channels into end-user premises via set-top boxes or other customer-premises equipment. IPTV is also used for media delivery around corporate and private networks. IPTV in the telecommunications arena is notable for its ongoing standardisation process (e.g., European Telecommunications Standards Institute).

IPTV services may be classified into live television and live media, with or without related interactivity; time shifting of media, e.g., catch-up TV (replays a TV show that was broadcast hours or days ago), start-over TV (replays the current TV show from its beginning); and video on demand (VOD) which involves browsing and viewing items of a media catalogue.
