# Television (TV) | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Television)

Television is a telecommunication system for broadcasting and receiving moving pictures and sound over a distance. The term has come to refer to all the aspects of television from the television set to the programming and transmission. The word is derived from mixed Latin and Greek roots, meaning "far sight": Greek "tele", far, and Latin vision, sight (from video, vis- to see).

### Cable Television | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cable_television)

Cable television is a system of delivering television programming to consumers via radio frequency (RF) signals transmitted through coaxial cables, or in more recent systems, light pulses through fibre-optic cables. This contrasts with broadcast television (also known as terrestrial television), in which the television signal is transmitted over-the-air by radio waves and received by a television antenna attached to the television; or satellite television, in which the television signal is transmitted over-the-air by radio waves from a communications satellite orbiting the Earth, and received by a satellite dish antenna on the roof. FM radio programming, high-speed Internet, telephone services, and similar non-television services may also be provided through these cables. Analog television was standard in the 20th century, but since the 2000s, cable systems have been upgraded to digital cable operation.

### Satellite Television | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_television)

Satellite television is a service that delivers television programming to viewers by relaying it from a communications satellite orbiting the Earth directly to the viewer's location. The signals are received via an outdoor parabolic antenna commonly referred to as a satellite dish and a low-noise block downconverter.

### Terrestrial Television | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrial_television)

Terrestrial television or over-the-air television (OTA) is a type of television broadcasting in which the signal transmission occurs via radio waves from the terrestrial (Earth-based) transmitter of a TV station to a TV receiver having an antenna. The term terrestrial is more common in Europe and Latin America, while in Canada and the United States it is called over-the-air or simply broadcast. This type of TV broadcast is distinguished from newer technologies, such as satellite television (direct broadcast satellite or DBS television), in which the signal is transmitted to the receiver from an overhead satellite; cable television, in which the signal is carried to the receiver through a cable; and Internet Protocol television, in which the signal is received over an Internet stream or on a network utilizing the Internet Protocol. Terrestrial television stations broadcast on television channels with frequencies between about 52 and 600 MHz in the VHF and UHF bands. Since radio waves in these bands travel by line of sight, reception is generally limited by the visual horizon to distances of 64–97 kilometres (40–60 mi), although under better conditions and with tropospheric ducting, signals can sometimes be received hundreds of kilometers distant.

## Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol_television)

Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) is the delivery of television content over Internet Protocol (IP) networks. This is in contrast to delivery through tranditional terrestrial, satellite, and cable television format. Unlike downloaded meida, IPTV offers the ability to stream the source media continuously. As a result, a client media player can being playing the content (such as a TV channel) almost immediately. This is known as streaming media.

Although IPTV uses the Internet protocol it is not limited to television streamed from the Internet (Internet television). IPTV is widely deployed in subscriber-based telecommunications networks with high-speed access channels into end-user premises via set-top boxes or other customer-premises equipment. IPTV is also used for media delivery around corporate and private networks. IPTV in the telecommunications arena is notable for its ongoing standardisation process (e.g., European Telecommunications Standards Institute).

IPTV services may be classified into live television and live media, with or without related interactivity; time shifting of media, e.g., catch-up TV (replays a TV show that was broadcast hours or days ago), start-over TV (replays the current TV show from its beginning); and video on demand (VOD) which involves browsing and viewing items of a media catalogue.

### Smart TV | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_TV)

A smart TV, also known as a connected TV (CTV), is a tranditional television set with integrated Internet and interactive Web 2.0 features, which allows users to stream music and videos, browse the internet, and view photos. Smart TVs are a technological convergence of computers, television, and digital media players. Besides the tranditional functions of television sets provided through tranditional broadcasting media, these devices can provide access to over-the-top media services such as streaming television and internet radio, along with home networking access.

### Set-top Box | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set-top_box)

An electronic device that makes it possible to watch digital broadcasts on ordinary television.

A set-top box (STB), also colloquially known as a cable box or receiver and hostorically television decoder, is an information appliance device that generally contains a TV-tuner input and displays output to a television set and an external source of signal, turning the source signal into content in a form that can then be displayed on the television screen or other display device. They are used in cable television, satellite television, and over-the-air television systems as well as other uses.
