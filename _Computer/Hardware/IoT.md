- Summary
  - IoT는 네트워크에 연결된 클라우드부터 센서 등을 비롯한 기기들이 정보를 수집, 가공, 처리하여 유의미한 결과를 내는 시스템이다.
  - 엣지 컴퓨팅, 클라우드 컴퓨팅, 머신러닝을 이용한 데이터 처리 방법이 있다.

The Internet of Things (IoT) describes physical objects (or groups of such as objects) with sensors, processing ability, software, and other technologies that connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the Internet or other communications networks. Internet of things has been considered a misnoomer because devices do not need to be connected to the public internet, they only need to be connected to a network and be individually addressable.

The field has evolved due to the convergence of multiple technologies, including ubiquitous computing, commodity sensors, increasingly powerful embedded systems, and machine learning. Tranditional fields of embedded systems, wireless sensor networks, control systems, automation (including home and building automation), independently and collectively enable the Internet of things. In the consumer market, IoT technology is most synonymous with products pertaining to the concept of the "smart home", including devices and appliances (such as lighting fixtures, thermostats, home security systems, cameras, and other home appliances) that support one or more common ecosystems, and can be controlled via devices associated with that ecosystem, such as smartphones and smart speakers. IoT is also used in healthcare systems.

There are number of concerns about the risks in the growth of IoT technologies and products, especially in the areas of privacy and security, and consequently, industry and governmental moves to address these concerns have begun, including the development of international and local standards, guidelines, and regulatory frameworks.

## What is IoT? | [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/iot/?nc1=h_ls)
The term IoT, or Internet of Things, refers to the collective netowrk of connected devices and the technology that facilitates communication between devices and the cloud, as well as between the devices themselves. Thanks to the advent of inexpensive computer chips and high bandwidth telecommunication, we now have billions of devices connected to the internet. This means everyday devices like toothbrushes, vacuums, cars, and machines can use sensors to collect data and respond intelligently to users.

The Internet of Things integrates everyday "things" with the internet. Computer Enginners have been adding sensors and processors to everyday objects since the 90s. However, progress was initially slow because the chips were big and bulky. Low power computer chips called RFID tags were first used to track expensive equipment. As computing devices shrank in size, these chips also became smaller, faster, and smarter over time.

The cost of integrating computing power into small objects has now dropped considerably. For example, you can add connectivity with Alexa voice services capabilities to MCUs with less than 1MB embedded RAM, such as for light switches. A whole industry has sprung up with a focus on filling our homes, businesses, and offices with IoT devices. These smart objects can automatically transmit data to and from the Internet. All these "invisible computing devices" and the technology associated with them are collectively referred to as the Internet of Things.

## How does IoT work?
A typical IoT system works through the real-time collection and exchange of data. An IoT system has three components:

### Smart devices
This is a device, like a television, security camera, or exercise equipment that has been give computing capabilities. It collects data from its environment, user inputs, or usage patterns and communicates data over the internet to and from its IoT application.

### IoT application
An Iot application is a collection of services and software that integrates data received from various IoT devices. It uses machine learning or artificial intelligence (AI) technology to analyze this data and make informed decisions. These decisions are communicated back to the IoT device and the IoT device then responds intelligently to inputs.

### A graphical user interface
The IoT device or fleet of devices can be managed through a graphical user interface. Common examples include a mobile application or website that can be used to register and control smart devices.

- What are examples of IoT devices? Connected cars, Connected homes, Smart cities, Smart buildings
- What is Industrial IoT? Manufacturing, Automobile, Logistics and transport, Retail
- How can IoT improve our lives?

- What are the benefits of IoT for business? Accelerate innovation, Turn data into insights and action with AI and ML, Increase security, Scale differentiated solutions

## What are IoT technologies?
### Edge computing
Edge computing refers to the technology used to make smart devices do more than just send or receive data to their IoT platform. It increases the computing power at the edges of an IoT network, reducing communication latency and improving response time.

### Cloud computing
Cloud technology is used for remote data storage and IoT device management - making the data accessible to multiple devices in the network.

### Machine learning
Machine learning regers to the software and algorithms used to process data and make real-time decisions based on that data. These machine learning algorithms can be deployed in the cloud or at the edge.

The Internet of Things (IoT) is made up of smart devices connected to a network, sending and receiving data to and from other devices. IoT creates new opportunities to gather data from the world around us and manage large numbers of devices in different physical locations. IoT also introduces the challenges of collecting, storing, and analyzing enourmous volumes of data.

IoT is a related concept to edge computing, a strategy for computing on location where data is collected or used. Many edge computing use cases, such as manufacturing and utilities, involve the use of Industrial IoT (IIoT) devices.

## What is the Internet of Things (IoT)? | [RedHat](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/internet-of-things/what-is-iot)
The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the process of connecting everyday physical objects to the internet-from common household objects like lightbulbs; to healthcare assets like medical devices; to wearables, smart devices, and even smart cities.

The Iot devices placed within those physical objects primarily fall into 1 to 2 categories: they are either a switch (that sends a command to a thing), or a sensor (that collects data and sends it elsewhere).
