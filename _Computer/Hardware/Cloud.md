## [Cloud Service](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-computing/what-are-cloud-services)

Cloud services are infrastructure, platforms, or software that are hosted by third-party providers and made available to users through the internet.

Examples: All infrastructure, platforms, software, or technologies that users access through the internet without requriting additional software downloads can be considered cloud computing services-including the following as-a-Service solutions.
- Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) provides users with compute, networking, and storage resources.
- Platforms-as-a-Service (PaaS) provides users with a platform on which application can run, as well as all the IT infrastructure required for it to run.
- Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) provides users with-essentially-a cloud application, the platform on which it runs, and the platform's underlying infrastructure.
- Function-as-a-Service (FaaS), an event-driven execution model, lets developers build, run, and manage app packages as functions without maintaining the infrastructure.
