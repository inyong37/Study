# [Database](https://www.oracle.com/database/what-is-database/)

A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. A database is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS). Together, the data and the DBMS, along with the applications that are associated with them, are referred to as a database system, often shortened to just database.

Data within the most common types of databases in operation today is typically modeled in rows and columns in a series of tables to make processing and data querying efficient. The data can then be easily accessed, managed, modified, updated, controlled, and organized. Most databases use structured query language (SQL) for writing and querying data.

### Structured Query Language (SQL)

SQL is a programming language used by nearly all relational databases to query, manipulate, and define data, and to provide access control. SQL was first developed at IBM in the 1970s with Oracle as as a major contributor, which led to implementation of the SQL ANSI standard, SQL has spurred many extensions from companies such as IBM, Oracle, and Microsoft. Although SQL is still widely used today, new programming languages are beginning to appear.

### What is the difference between a database and a spreadsheet?

Databases and spreadsheets (such as Microsoft Excel) are both convenient ways to store information. The primary differences between the two are: How the data is stored and manipulated, Who can access the data, How much data can be stored.

Spreadsheets were originally designed for one user, and their characteristics reflect that. They're great for a single user or small number of users who don't need to do a lot of incredibly complicated data manipulation. Databases, on the other hand, are designed to hold much larger collections of organized information-massive amounts, sometimes. Databases allow multiple users at the same time to quickly and securely access and query the data using highly complex logic and language.

### [Relational Database](https://www.oracle.com/database/what-is-a-relational-database/)

A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another. Relational databases are based on the relational model, an intuitive, straightforward way of representing data in tables. In a relational database, each row in the table is a record with a unique ID called the key. The columns of the table hold attributes of the data, and each record usually has a value for each attribute, making it easy to establish the relationships among data points.

Relational databases became dominant in the 1980s. Items in a relational database are organized as a set of tables with columns and rows. Relational database technology provides the most efficient and flexible way to access structured information.

### Object-oriented Database

Information in an object-oriented database is represented in the form of objects, as in object-oriented programming.

### Distributed Databse

A distirubted database consists of two or more files located in different sites. The database may be stored on multiple computers, located in the same physical location, or scattered over different networks.

### Data Warehouse

A central repository for data, a data warehouse is a type of database specifically designed for fast query and analysis.

### NoSQL Database

A NoSQL, or nonrelational database, allows unstructured and semistructured data to be stored and manipulated (in contrast to a relational databse, which defines how all data inserted into the database must be composed). NoSQL databases grew popular as web applications became more common and more complex.

### Graph Database

A graph database stores data in terms of entities and the relationships between entities. OLTP databases. An OLTP database is a speedy, analytic database designed for large number of transactions performed by multiple users.

These are only a few of the several dozen types of databases in use today. Other, less common databases are tailored to very specific scientific, financial, or other functions. In addition to the different database types, changes in technology development approaches and dramatic advances such as the cloud and automation are propelling databases in entirely new directions. Some of the latest databases include

### Open source Database

An open source database system is one whose source code is open source; such databases could be SQL or NoSQL databases.

### Cloud Databases

A cloud database is a collection of data, either structured or unstructured, that resides on a private, public, or hybrid cloud computing platform. There are two types of cloud database models: traditional and database as a service (DBaaS). With DBaaS, administrative tasks and maintenance are performed by a service provider.

### Multimodel Database

Multimodel databases combine different types of database models into a single, integrated back end. This means they can accommodate various data types.

### Document/JSON Database

Designed for stroing, retrieving, and managing document-oriented information, document databases are a modern way to store data in JSON format rather than rows and columns.

### Self-driving Database

The newest and most groundbreaking type of databse, self-driving databases (also known as autonomous databases) are cloud-based and use machine learning to automate database tuning, security, backups, updates, and other routine management tasks traditionally performed by databse administrators.
