### DAT | Data File

A DAT file is a generic data file created by a specific application. It may contain data in binary or text format. DAT files are typically accessed only by the application that created them.

### DTB | Device Tree Blob File

A DTB file is a device tree (or devicetree) blob file used by the Linux kernel. It contains binary data that describes a computer's hardware. DTB files allow operating systems to manage a computer's components by telling the operating system what hardware the computer includes.

### IMG | Disc Image Data File

An IMG file is a disk image file created by various disk imaging applications, such as H+H Software Virtual CD. It stores an exact copy of the data on a CD or DVD and is used for backups and buring new discs.

### IMG | Machintosh Disk Image

An IMG file is a disk image used to mount a file system. It can be mounted like a disk drive (e.g., an external hard drive) or an optical disc (e.g., a CD or DVD). IMG files are stored on the hard drive but are recognized as a disc or hard disk when mounted by the computer.

### ISO | Disc Image File

An ISO file is a common CD or DVD disc image format based on the ISO-9660 standard. It contains an exact duplicate of data from the original disc, which includes the data saved on the disc as well as the filesystem information, such as directory structures, file attributes, and boot code. ISO files are often used for making copies of CDs and DVDs.
