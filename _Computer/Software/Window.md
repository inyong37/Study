# [Window System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windowing_system)

A windowing system (or window system) is software that manages separately different parts of display screens. It is a type of graphical user interface (GUI) which implements the WIMP (windows, icons, menus, pointers) paradigm for a user interface.

## [Display Server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windowing_system#Display_server) | [List of Display Servers Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_display_servers)

A display server or window server is a program whose primary task is to coordinate the input and output of its clients to and from the rest of the operating system, the hardware, and each other. The display server communicates with its clients over the display server protocol, a communications protocol, which can be network-transparent or simply network-capable. The display server is a key component in any graphical user interface, specifically the windowing system.

## Display Server Communications Protocols

### [X.Org](https://www.x.org/wiki/) (X Window System, X11) | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System)

The X Window System (X11, or simply X) is a windowing system for bitmap displays, common on Unix-like operating systems.

### [Wayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/) | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayland_(protocol))

Wayland is a communication protocol that specifies the communication between a display server and its clients, as well as a C library implementation of that protocol. A display server using the Wayland protocol is called a Wayland compositor, because it additionally performs the task of a compositing window manager.
