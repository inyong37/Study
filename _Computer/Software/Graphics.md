# [Graphics Library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_library)

A graphics library is a program library designed to aid in rendering computer graphics to a monitor. This typically involves providing optimized versions of functions that handle common rendering tasks. This can be done purely in software and running on the CPU, common in embedded systems, or being hardware accelerated by a GPU, more common in PCs. By employing these functions, a program can assemble an image to be output to a monitor. This relieves the programmer of the task of creating and optimizing these functions, and allows them to focus on building the graphics program. Graphics libraries are mainly used in video games and simulations.

### [GTK](https://www.gtk.org/) | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GTK)

GTK (formerly GTK+) is a free and open-source cross-platform widget toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs). It is licensed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License, allowing both free and proprietary software to use it. It is one of the most popular toolkits for the Wayland and X11 windowing systems.

### [Mesa 3D](https://www.mesa3d.org/) | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesa_(computer_graphics))

Mesa, also called Mesa3D and The Mesa 3D Graphics Library, is an open source implementation of OpenGL, Vulkan, and other graphics API specifications. Mesa translates these specifications to vendor-specific graphics hardware drivers.

### [Vulkan](https://www.vulkan.org/) | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulkan)

Vulkan is a low-overhead, cross-platform API, open standard for 3D graphics and computing.

### [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qt_(software))

Qt (pronounced "cute") is a cross-platform software for creating graphical user interfaces as well as cross-platform applications that run on various software and hardware platforms such as Linux, Windows, macOS, Android or embedded systems with little or no change in the underlying codebase while still being a native application with native capabilities and speed.

### [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/) | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL)

OpenGL (Open Graphics Library) is a cross-language, cross-platform application programming interface (API) for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics. The API is typically used to interact with a graphics processing unit (GPU), to achieve hardware-accelerated rendering.

Silicon Graphics, Inc. (SGI) began developing OpenGL in 1991 and released it on June 30, 1992; applications use it extensively in the fields of computer-aided design (CAD), virtual reality, scientific visualization, information visualization, flight simulation, and video games. Since 2006, OpenGL has been managed by the non-profit technology consortium Khronos Group.

### [OpenGL ES](https://www.khronos.org/opengles/) | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL_ES)

OpenGL for Embedded Systems (OpenGL ES or GLES) is a subset of the OpenGL computer graphics rendering application programming interface (API) for rendering 2D and 3D computer graphics such as those used by video games, typically hardware-accelerated using a graphics processing unit (GPU). It is designed for embedded systems like smartphones, tablet computers, video game consoles and PDAs. OpenGL ES is the "most widely deployed 3D graphics API in history". The API is cross-language and multi-platform.
