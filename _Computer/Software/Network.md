### DNS: Domain Name System | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System) | [Wiki (Kor)](https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EB%8F%84%EB%A9%94%EC%9D%B8_%EB%84%A4%EC%9E%84_%EC%8B%9C%EC%8A%A4%ED%85%9C)
The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network. It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities. Most prominently, it translates more readily memorized domain names to the numerical IP addresses needed for locating and identifying computer services and devices with the underlying network protocols. By providing a worldwide, distributed directory service, the Domain Name System has been an essential component of the functionality of the Internet since 1985.

The Domain Name System delegates the responsibility of assigning domain names and mapping those names to Internet resources by designating authoritative name servers for each domain. Network administrators may delegate authority over sub-domains of their allocated name space to other name servers. This mechanism provides distributed and fault-tolerant service and was designed to avoid a single large central database.

The Domain Name System also specifies the technical functionality of the database service that is at its core. It defines the DNS protocol, a detailed specification of the data structures and data communication exchanges used in the DNS, as part of the Internet Protocol Suite.

The Internet maintains two principal namespaces, the domain name hierarchy and the Internet Protocol (IP) address spaces. The Domain Name System maintains the domain name hierarchy and provides translation services between it and the address spaces. Internet name servers and a communication protocol implement the Domain Name System. A DNS name server is a server that stores the DNS records for a domain; a DNS name server responds with answers to queries against its database.

The most common types of records stored in the DNS database are for Start of Authority (SOA), IP addresses (A and AAAA), SMTP mail exchangers (MX), name servers (NS), pointers for reverse DNS lookups (PTR), and domain name aliases (CNAME). Although not intended to be a general purpose database, DNS has been expanded over time to store records for other types of data for either automatic lookups, such as DNSSEC records, or for human queries such as responsible person (RP) records. As a general purpose database, the DNS has also been used in combating unsolicited email (spam) by storing a real-time blackhole list (RBL). The DNS database is traditionally stored in a structured text file, the zone file, but other database systems are common.

### DDNS: Dynamic DNS | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_DNS) | [Wiki (Kor)](https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDNS)
Dynamic DNS (DDNS) is a method of automatically updating a name server in the Domain Name System (DNS), often in real time, with the active DDNS configuration of its configured hostnames, addresses or other information.

The term is used to describe two different concepts. The first is "dynamic DNS updating" which refers to systems that are used to update traditional DNS records without manual editing. These mechanisms are explained in RFC 2136, and use the TSIG mechanism to provide security. The second kind of dynamic DNS permits lightweight and immediate updates often using an update client, which do not use the RFC2136 standard for updating DNS records. These clients provide a persistent addressing method for devices that change their location, configuration or IP address frequently.

### Anonymous Pipe | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_pipe) | [Blog (KR-KO)](https://12bme.tistory.com/226)
An anonymous pipe is a simple FIFO communication chaneel that may be used for one-way IPC(InterProcess Communication). AN implementation is often integrated into the operating system's file IO subsystem. Typically a parent program opens anonymous pipes, and creates a new porcess that inherits the other ends of the pipes, or creates several new processes and arranges them in a pipeline. Ful-duplex(two-way) communication normally requires two anonymous pipes. Pipelines are supported in most popular operating systems, from Unix and DOS onwards, and are created using the "|" character in many shells.

### Named Pipe | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named_pipe) | [Blog (KR-KO)](https://mug896.github.io/bash-shell/named_pipe.html)
A named pips(also known as a FIFO for its behavior) is an extension to the traditional pipe concept on Unix and Unix-like systems, and is one of the methods of IPC. The concepth is also found in OS/2 and Microsoft Windows, althought the semantics differ substantially. A tranditional pipe is unnamed and lasts only as long as the process. A named pipe, however, can last as long as the system is up, beyond the life of the process. It can be deleted if no longer used, Usually a named pipe appears as a file, and generally processes attach to it for IPC.

### File Descriptor | [Wiki (KR-KO)](https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%ED%8C%8C%EC%9D%BC_%EC%84%9C%EC%88%A0%EC%9E%90)
File descriptor(파일 서술자/기술자)는 특정한 파일에 접근하기 위한 추상적인 키이다. 이 용어는 일반적으로 POSIX 운영 체제에 쓰인다. Microsoft Windows와 C 표준 입출력 라이브러리 환경에서는 file handle(파일 핸들)이라는 말이 선호되지만 후자의 경우 기술적으로 다른 객체이다. POSIX에서 fd는 정수, 곧 C형 int를 말한다. 모든 프로세스가 갖추어야 하는 표준 POSIX fd는 다음과 같이 3개가 있다. 1. 정숫값 0인 경우 stdin(표준 입력), 2. 정숫값이 1인 경우 stdout(표준 출력), 3. 정숫값이 2인 경우 stderr(표준 오류)이다.

### URI vs. URL vs. URN
Uniform Resource Identifier(URI), Uniform Resource Locator(URL), and Uniform Resource Name(URN)는 각 네트워크 상에 존재하는 자원을 구분하는 ID(식별자), 네트워크 상에 존재하는 resource의 location, 중복되지 않는 유일한 resource name을 나타낸다. URN, URL은 URI에 포함된다. 따라서 URN, URL은 URI라 할 수 있다. URL은 where을 나타내는 것으로 자원에 접근하는 방법이나 네트워크 위치를 표현하고 있다. http://, https://, ftp:// 등이 포함되면 URL이다. URN은 what을 나타내는 것으로 해당 자원이 무엇인지 중복되지 않는 유일한 식별 가능한 이름이어야 한다.

### Cloud Computing
Cloud computing은 여러 deivces에서 나온 정보들을 cloud에서 전부 처리하는 computing environment이다.

### Edge Computing
Edge computing은 cloud에서 모든 연산을 처리하는 것이 아닌, mobile devices들이 직접 연산을 하거나 edge들에서 데이터 연산을 하여 cloud에 데이터를 뿌려주는 것이다.
