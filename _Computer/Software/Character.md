# Character

## ASCII | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII)
ASCII, abbreviated from American Standard Code for Information Interchange, is a character encoding standard for electronic commnunication. ASCII codes represent text in computers, telecommunications equipment, and other devices. Most modern character-encoding schemes are based on ASCII, although they support many additional characters.

The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) prefers the name US-ASCII for this character encoding.

ASCII is one of the IEEE milestones.

Work on the ASCII standard began in May 1961, with the first meeting of the American Standards Association's (ASA) (now the American National Standards Institute or ANSI) X3.2 subcommittee. The first edition of the standard was published in 1963, underwent a major revision during 1967, and experienced its most recent update during 1986. Compared to eariler telegraph codes, the proposed Bell code and ASCII were both ordered for more convenient sorting (i.e., alphabetization) of lists, and added features for devices other than teleprinters.

## ANSI | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_character_set)
The phrase ANSI character set has no well-defined meaning and has been used to refer to the following, among other things:

Windows code pages, a collection of 8-bit character sets compatible with ASCII but incompatible with each other, especially those code pages that are partly compatible with ISO-8859, most commonly Windows Latin 1.

Windows-1252 is referred to as "ANSI" especially often.

Code page 437, the character set of the original IBM PC (especially in the context of ANSI art which is used as graphics especially in BBS and made as demoscene products.)

## Windows Code Page | [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_code_page)
Windows code pages are sets of characters or code pages (known as character encodings in other operating systems) used in Microsoft Windows from the 1980s and 1990s. Windows code pages were gradually superseded when Unicode was implemented in Windows, although they are still supported both within Windows and other platforms, and still apply when Alt code shortcuts are used.

There are two groups of code pages in Windows systems: OEM and Windows-native ("ANSI") code pages. Code pages in both of these groups are extended ASCII code pages.

## Multi Byte Character Sets

## Unicode | [Homepage](https://home.unicode.org/)
Unicode provides a unique number for every character, no matter what the platform, program, or language is.

## UTF-8 | [Homepage](https://www.utf8.com/)
Unicode Transformation Format 8-bit is a variable-width encoding that can represent every character in the Unicode character set. It was designed for backward compatibility with ASCII and to avoid the complications of endianness and byte order marks in UTF-16 and UTF-32.

## Byte Order Mark (BOM)

## UTF-16 Little Endian (LE)
Load with backward, usually used in Microsoft Windows.

## UTF-16 Big Endian (BE)
Load with forward, usually used in Apple MacOS, and JAVA.
