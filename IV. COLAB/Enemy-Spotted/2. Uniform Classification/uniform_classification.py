# Few-shot Learning
### Approach: Data-driven vs. Model-based
- Data-drive Approach: data generation with VAE and GAN

### Model-based Approach: Metric Learning vs. Graph Neural Networks (GNN)
- Metric Learning
  - Siamese Neural Network for One-shot Image Recognition
  - Matching Networks for One-shot learning
  - Prototypical Networks for Few-shot Learning
  - Learning to Compare: Relation Network for Few-shot Learning

- Graph Neural Networks (GNN)
  - Few-shot Learning with Graph Neural Networks
  - Transductive Propagation Network for Few-shot Learning (TPN)
  - Edge-Labeling Graph Neural Network for Few-shot Learning (EGNN)

### Transfer Learning vs. Meta Learning (Episodic Learning, Learning-to-Learn)
