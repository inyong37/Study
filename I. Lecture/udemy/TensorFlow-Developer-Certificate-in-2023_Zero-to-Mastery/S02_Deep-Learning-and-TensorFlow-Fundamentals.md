## 6. What is deep learning?

- Trandtional programming starts with inputs and rules and makes output. However, the machine learning algorithm starts with inputs and output, and figures out rules.

## 7. Why use deep learning?

- For a complex problem, can you think of all the rules?
- If you can build a simple rule-based system that doesn't require machine learning, do that. Google ML engineer rule 1.
  - Rules of Machine Learning
- What deep learning is good for
  - Problems with long list of rules
  - Continually changing environmnets
  - Discovering insights within large collections of data
- What deep learning is not good for
  - When you need explainability
  - When the tranditional approach is a better option
  - When errors are unacceptable
  - When you don't have much data
- Machine learning (shallow algorithm) fits structured data, whereas deep learning fits unstructured data

## 8. What are neural networks?

- Neural Networks
  - Inputs, Numerical encoding, Learns representation (pattern/feature/weights), Representation outputs, Outputs
- Anatomy
  - Input layer; data goes in here, Hidden layer(s); learns patterns in data, Output layer; outputs learned representation or prediction probabilites
- Types of Learning
  - Supervised Learning, Semi-supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Transfer Learning
